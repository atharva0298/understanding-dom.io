## Document-Object-Model

Increasing my understanding of JS by learning DOM on the go by doing hands-on work on an Item-Lister App.

So, this is basically an Item-Lister app, which is made for improving the understanding of JS DOM, event listeners and query selectors. This app works on three main functions
- ADD ITEMS
- DELETE ITEMS
- FILTER AND SEARCH


All the three functions are coded using Javascript and are working successfully.
